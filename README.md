### Idea
In domains, where simmple thought  processes and sub solutions, can be easily verified and generated, one could use CLIP to encode and train on those domans to think and solve the sim2comsim problem.

### Experiments:
* RL Game - in the optimal case: 2D, 3D
* Arc-AGI: maybe? just for visual reasoning


### Datasets



### Training


## To-Do's
* Get dataset
* Get CLIP
